This is a simple Blockchain NFT Matching Game can be improved more. I would like to thank DApp University for helping me with this study. I tried to change some things with Lestonz difference. Further improvements can be made, for example, progress can be made by level. It can be 2x2, 3x3, 4x4, 5x5 â€¦ 10x10 for mega prize. "Game is Over" can happen when you guess wrong 3 times in the game. He can also win mega rewards if he reaches the last level.
